The Hitchhiker's Guide to PHP Math Functions
Each step of the project provides a math operation that can be completed using built-in PHP functions. Use the documentation to find them and apply them correctly to get the answer.

Functions
1.
We have given you an $initial value to start from as an octal string. (octal is a base 8 system of notation, instead of the likely more familiar decimal base 10 system).

Using the PHP Documentation, find a PHP function to convert this octal string to a decimal number.

Sometimes it might be easier to use your favorite search engine to locate the right page within the PHP documentation.

Save the result in a variable $a. Throughout this project, print your result at each step and check it against the hint. Be sure to add a newline at the end of each print statement.


Hint
Use the octdec() function.

$a should be 365.

2.
The value of $a is a number of degrees. Use a PHP function to convert it to radians and store the result in a new variable, $b.


Hint
Use the deg2rad() function.

$b should be 6.3704517697793.

3.
Use a built-in PHP function to take the cosine of $b and store it in a new variable, $c.


Hint
Use the cos() function.

$c should be 0.99619469809175.

4.
Use a built-in PHP function to round $c to 3 decimal places and store the result in a new variable, $d.


Hint
Use the round() function.

Be sure to pass 3 as the second argument to set the number of decimal places.

$d should be 0.996.

5.
Find a PHP function to take the natural log of $d and store the result in a new variable, $e.


Hint
Use the log() function.

$e should be -0.0040080213975388.

6.
Use a PHP function to take the absolute value of $e and store it in $f.


Hint
Use the abs() function.

$f should be 0.0040080213975388.

7.
Use a PHP function to take the inverse, or arc cosine of $f and store the result in $g.


Hint
Use the acos() function.

$g should be 1.5667882946663.

8.
$g is a number in radians. Use a PHP function to convert this to a number of degrees and store it as $h.


Hint
Use the rad2deg() function.

$h should be 89.770356674879.

9.
Use a PHP function to floor (round down) $h and store the result in $i.


Hint
Use the floor() function.

$i should be 89.

10.
Subtract 47 from $i to arrive at the solution, $j.


Hint
The solution should be 42.
