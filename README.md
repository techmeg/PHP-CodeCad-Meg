# PHP-CodeCad-Meg

This repo contains code from both parts of the Introduction to PHP course created for Alley. The first half are lessons from Codecademy contained in two folders: one for the instructions for doing the Pro content projects and a second folder with the code.

The third folder contains all the code as it was cumulatively built in the Laracast course "The PHP Practitioner"
